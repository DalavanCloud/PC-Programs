Before updating the programs for the local server
-------------------------------------------------

1. Be sure **where** the programs (**bin folder**) are installed. E.g.: c:\\scielo.
2. Be sure **where** the data (**serial folder**) are stored. E.g.: c:\\scielo.
3. Only some files in **code folder** will be updated. Be sure you have  **your code folder** in **serial** before updating. DO NOT copy **serial** contents after updating. But in case you have done it, reinstall the programs again.
