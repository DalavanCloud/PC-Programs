XML Markup
==========

Use the Markup Program to identify all the elements of the document, but instead of using body (SGML) tag, use xmlbody to identify the full text.

xmlbody contains a complex hierarchical structure. It contains xref, uri, url, p, sec, title, label, and other tags to identify elements inside the body.

Read about `Markup Tags <markup_tags.html>`_.
